# CASS a computercraft casino


These scripts are made in Computercraft Tweaked (1.113.1) for Minecraft version 1.20.1

These sets of scripts are not finished, most progress was made during a '2 week Minecraft phase' that lasted a little longer than the usual 2 weeks.
Current implementation is very naive and has one unfinished game, the 'sportsbetting' which allows people to set up a prompt and others to bet on it. Currencies are virtual and no profit is taken from the house.
Plan was to get a slots and blackjack game as well but I didn't get that far.

The choice to have a very naive, plain text method is that most users on the server were not interested in Computercraft and do not know anything except the paint program. This allowed me to cut corners and have it this way.
